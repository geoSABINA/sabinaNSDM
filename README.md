# sabinaNSDM: Spatially-nested Hierarchical Species Distribution Models (NSDM)



 <!-- <img width="252" alt="logo_s-1" src="https://github.com/geoSABINA/sabinaNSDM/assets/168073517/d29288b9-c1a7-47aa-8753-918c931e4c53">-->

 

   


## Overview

The <strong>sabinaNSDM</strong> R package generates <strong>spatially-nested hierarchical species distribution models (NSDMs)</strong> that integrates species distribution models (SDMs) at various spatial scales to address niche truncation and produce more reliable predictions than traditional non-hierarchical SDMs. <strong>sabinaNSDM</strong> combines two SDMs calibrated with species occurrences and environmental covariates at global and regional scales. The global-scale model allows capturing extensive ecological niches, while the regional-scale model features high-resolution drivers of species distributions. This toolkit is designed to facilitate the implementation of NSDMs for ecologists, conservationists, and researchers aiming to produce more reliable species distribution predictions.

<strong>sabinaNSDM</strong> streamlines the data preparation, calibration, integration, and projection of models across two scales. It automates (if necessary) the generation of background points, spatial thinning of species occurrences and absences (if available), covariate selection, single-scale modelling (global and regional), and the generation of NSDMs using two approaches (‚Äúcovariate‚Äù and ‚Äúmultiply‚Äù). <strong>sabinaNSDM</strong> models use an ensemble modelling approach that combines multiple statistical techniques with the <strong>biomod2</strong> package (*Ecography*, <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03673.x>, Thuiller et al. 2009), thinning of species occurrences and absences with the <strong>ecospat</strong> package (*Ecography*, <https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02671.x>, Di Cola et al. 2017), and covariate selection of the <strong>covsel</strong>  package (*Ecological Informatics*,<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102080>, Adde et al. 2023b).

### Data preparation <a name="data_preparation">

First, set your working directory and load the required packages.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# setwd("/path/to/your/project")
#
if(!requireNamespace("sabinaNSDM", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("terra")
  install.packages("biomod2")
  install.packages("ecospat")
  install.packages("fs")
  install.packages("sgsR")
  install.packages("remotes")
  if(!requireNamespace("covsel", quietly = TRUE)) {
    remotes::install_github("N-SDM/covsel")
  }
  
  library(terra)
  library(covsel)
  library(biomod2)
  library(ecospat)
  library(fs)
  library(sgsR)
  remotes::install_github("geoSABINA/sabinaNSDM")
}

# Load the sabinaNSDM package
library(sabinaNSDM)
```
Define the species name
```{r eval = FALSE}
SpeciesName <- "Fagus.sylvativa"
```
Load species occurrence and environmental covariates data. Species occurrence *data.frame* must include only two columns: ‚Äúx‚Äù and ‚Äùy‚Äù coordinates. No row names. The coordinate projection must match that used for the covariates.

```{r eval = FALSE}
 # Species occurrences
 data(Fagus.sylvatica.xy.global, package = "sabinaNSDM")
 spp.data.global <- Fagus.sylvatica.xy.global
 data(Fagus.sylvatica.xy.regional, package = "sabinaNSDM")
 spp.data.regional <- Fagus.sylvatica.xy.regional
```
The covariates for each spatial scale (i.e., global and regional) should be provided as *SpatRaster*, with each band corresponding to a different covariate. The regional-scale *SpatRaster*  must include all the covariates included in the global-scale file, and it can additionally include covariates only available at this level.

 ```{r eval = FALSE}
 data(expl.var.global, package = "sabinaNSDM")
 data(expl.var.regional, package = "sabinaNSDM")
 expl.var.global <- terra::unwrap(expl.var.global)
 expl.var.regional <- terra::unwrap(expl.var.regional)
```
Additionally, regional-scale *SpatRaster* or a *list of SpatRaster objects* corresponding to the covariates used to project the models at one or several different scenarios (i.e., new scenarios) can be provided.  

 ```{r eval = FALSE}
# new scenarios
 data(new.env, package = "sabinaNSDM")
 new.env <- terra::unwrap(new.env)
```
Load the required data for the package with the *NSDM.InputData()* function
 ```{r eval = FALSE}
nsdm_input <- NSDM.InputData(SpeciesName = SpeciesName,
                    spp.data.global = Fagus.sylvatica.xy.global, 
                    spp.data.regional = Fagus.sylvatica.xy.regional, 
                    expl.var.global = expl.var.global, 
                    expl.var.regional = expl.var.regional,
                    new.env = new.env,
                    new.env.names = "scenario1",
                    Background.Global = NULL, 
                    Background.Regional = NULL,
                    Absences.Global = NULL,
                    Absences.Regional = NULL)

```
Format the data with the *NSDM.FormattingData()* function. This function generates random or stratified background points for model calibration when no specific background or true absence data was loaded in the *NSDM.InputData()* function. Additionally, it applies spatial thinning to species occurrences and absences (if available) to remove duplicates and enforce a minimum distance criterion (by default the resolution of the variables). 
 ```{r eval = FALSE}
nsdm_finput <- NSDM.FormattingData(nsdm_input,
                nPoints = 100, # number of background points
                Min.Dist.Global = "resolution",
                Min.Dist.Regional = "resolution",
                Background.method = "random", # method ‚Äúrandom" or "stratified‚Äù to generate background points 
                save.output = TRUE) #save outputs locally

```
*NSDM.SelectCovariates()* function selects the most relevant and uncorrelated environmental covariates for both global and regional scales.
```{r eval = FALSE}
nsdm_selvars <- NSDM.SelectCovariates(nsdm_finput,
                maxncov.Global = 5,   # Max number of covariates to be selected at the global scale
                maxncov.Regional = 7, # Max number of covariates to be selected at the regional scale
                corcut = 0.7, #  correlation threshold
                algorithms = c("glm","gam","rf"),
                ClimaticVariablesBands = NULL, # covariate bands to be excluded in the covariate selection at the regional scale
                save.output = TRUE)

```


### Single scale modelling <a name="single_scale_modelling">

*NSDM.Global()* function generates the global component of the NSDM.

```{r eval = FALSE}
nsdm_global <- NSDM.Global(nsdm_selvars,
                algorithms = c("GAM","GBM", "RF", "MAXNET","GLM"),# Statistical algorithms used for modelling
                CV.nb.rep = 10, # number of cross-validation repetitions
                CV.perc = 0.8, # percentage of the data will be used for training in each cross-validation fold
                metric.select.thresh = 0.8, #  AUC threshold to include replicates in the final ensemble model
                CustomModelOptions = NULL, # Allows users to apply custom modelling options. 
                save.output = TRUE, 
                rm.biomod.folder = TRUE) # Remove the temporary folders created by `biomod2` 

```

*NSDM.Regional()* function generates the regional component of the NSDM.


```{r eval = FALSE}
nsdm_regional <- NSDM.Regional(nsdm_selvars,
                algorithms = c("GAM","GBM", "RF", "MAXNET","GLM"),
                CV.nb.rep = 10,
                CV.perc = 0.8,
                # metric.select.thresh = 0.8,
                CustomModelOptions = NULL, 
                save.output = TRUE,
                rm.biomod.folder = TRUE)

```



### Nested modelling <a name="nested_modelling">

*NSDM.Covariate()* function generates a NSDM with the covariate strategy. The covariate strategy incorporates the output of global models as an additional covariate in the regional model. 
```{r eval = FALSE}
nsdm_covariate <- NSDM.Covariate(nsdm_global,
                algorithms = c("GAM","GBM", "RF", "MAXNET","GLM"),
                rm.corr=TRUE,
                CV.nb.rep = 10,
                CV.perc = 0.8,
                # metric.select.thresh = 0.8,
                CustomModelOptions = NULL,
                save.output = TRUE,
                rm.biomod.folder = TRUE)
```
*NSDM.Multiply()* function generates a NSDM with the multiply strategy. The covariate averages the output of the global and the regional models. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
nsdm_multiply <- NSDM.Multiply(nsdm_global,
                nsdm_regional,
                method = "Arithmetic", # Method for averate model outputs: "Arithmetic" or "Geometric" mean
                rescale = FALSE,
                save.output=TRUE)
```

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <a name="FAQ">


1. [How do I install sabinaNSDM?](#instalation)
2. [How should I cite sabinaNSDM?](#citation)
3. <strong>How can I run a single-level (non-nested) model?</strong>
Provide your data only in the regional argument of NSDM.InputData() (set the global input as NULL). Then follow the standard workflow:
  NSDM.InputData(regional = my_data) %>%
  NSDM.FormattingData() %>%
  NSDM.SelectCovariates() %>%
  NSDM.Regional()
4. [How do I run models in parallel for multiple species?](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111%2F2041-210X.14417&file=mee314417-sup-0002-Supinfo2.pdf)
5. <strong>Is there a minimum number of species occurrences required?</strong>
   No, it depends on the user. However, at least 15 occurrences are strongly recommended to ensure more robust and stable model fitting.
6. <strong> What is the format of input data?</strong>
   Species occurrences should be provided as a data.frame with exactly two columns: x and y, representing the species presence coordinates. Do not include row names. The coordinate projection must match that of the environmental covariates.Environmental variables for each spatial scale (i.e., global and regional) should be provided as SpatRaster objects, with each band corresponding to a different covariate. The regional-scale SpatRaster must include all covariates present in the global-scale file, and may additionally include covariates that are only available at the regional level.
Additionally, a regional-scale SpatRaster or a list of SpatRaster objects corresponding to the covariates used to project the models under one or more alternative scenarios (e.g., future climate projections) can be provided.
7. <strong>How are background points generated?</strong>
By default, background points are automatically created by the package if not provided in NSDM.InputData(). In this case, the NSDM.FormattingData() function generates 10,000 background points per scale (default, user-customizable), which can be randomly distributed (default) or stratified.
Random method: background points are generated by selecting random cells from the environmental rasters at each scale and extracting their coordinates.
Stratified method: based on a PCA of all environmental covariates. The first two principal components are divided into quartiles and combined to create 16 strata. Background points are then sampled randomly within each stratum in proportion to its area, using the sgsR R package (Goodbody et al., 2023).
8. <strong>How do I generate uncertainty maps for ensemble models?</strong>
rom version 1.1.0 onward, an additional raster layer EMcv.tif is produced automatically, showing the coefficient of variation (standard deviation / mean) across ensemble models. This allows users to easily identify areas of high consensus and areas with greater disagreement among models.
9. <strong>What statistical algorithms are used?</strong>
sabinaNSDM supports an ensemble approach using multiple algorithms. Currently implemented methods include:
GAM (Generalized Additive Models)
GBM (Generalized Boosted Models)
GLM (Generalized Linear Models)
MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines)
MAXNET (Maximum Entropy models)
RF (Random Forests)
10. <strong>What types of validation are used?</strong>
By default, k-fold cross-validation is implemented, where the number of folds is user-defined.
From version 1.1.0 onward, the package also supports block spatial cross-validation, where both the number of folds and block size are user-defined. This method accounts for spatial autocorrelation and provides more reliable model evaluation in spatially structured datasets.
